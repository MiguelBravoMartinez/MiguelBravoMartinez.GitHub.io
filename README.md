## Interesting Data Set
Although all the provided Data Sets look really interesting, the <a href="https://github.com/datasets/covid-19">Covid-19</a> (https://github.com/datasets/covid-19) one cought my interest. The reason why I chose this one is because we went through a really difficult and hard situation during the period when Covid-19 was hitting our lives. I think this is a worldwide example of how Data can be used to help the world. With this Data Set, we could expect the change on the daily new infections, we could see how the virus is moving (more and less affected areas) and find the reason why this virus was spreading that fast and even find the origin of it. We can also compare the efficacy of different vaccines even that variable was taken into consideration and many more things. Finally, another important application we could give to this Data Set would be the prediction of new peaks (a lot of infections in a small period of time) to be ready and supply that region with more vaccines or medicines. <a href="https://datahub.io/core/covid-19">Here</a> (https://datahub.io/core/covid-19) you can find the direct link to download the data.  
## Interesting Book
I chose <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">Interactive Data Visualization for the Web -Scott Murray-</a> (https://www.oreilly.com) as a book that interests me because this term I am taking another course of Data Visualization and I am enjoying it a lot. I am a beginner in this matter and this book is for beginners, that is also a reason why I chose this one. I think it is really impotant to plot and visualize data, not only because it is easier to understand it, but also because it allows us to discover errors and mistakes we did not realize about. Once we finish a research or a project, our main target would probably be to expose it to the rest of the world. Not everyone understands statistics  or data management, so visual elements are the main resource we have to explain our data, purpose and conclusions of our project.
